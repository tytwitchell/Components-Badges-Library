# Components Library

I created this project to showcase my ability to design components that other developers could easily customize and integrate into their work. This project utilizes Context to pass data to child components and organizes the components using consistent nomenclature, neatly placed in separate folders.

To provide guidance in my code, I utilized JSDoc tags to describe the sections of the code where developers   can modify text and styles of the components. I ensured that all edits could easily be made in the index.jsx file, preventing other developers from needing to open up the component files to make their style and text decisions.

For demonstration purposes, I included an interactive UI element that changes the text of the banner component
