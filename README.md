# Components-Badges-Practice

I made this project to showcase my ability to make components that other developers on my team could easily edit and integrate into their projects.  
To help guide them, I used JSDoc tags to describe where in the code they could edit the text and/or styles of the components.  

For demonstration purposes, I made an interactive UI to change the text and styles of the badge and banner components
